Authorization
=============

TLDR
----
 -  Decorate your controller function with ``@authorize(permission)``.
 -  assign ``permission`` to the control group (id=0)
 -  assign ``permission`` to groups you wish to have access via the admin interface at /permissions

Client information
------------------

Information about the client can be found in the DynamicContent instance you controller is being called with by accessing the `client` field of the `request` field.

The field contains an instance of `dycm.users.client.Information` which provides a `check_permission(self, permission)` method, which can be used to check whether a specific `permission` has been assigned to the group this user belongs to.

Decorator
---------

The module ``dycm.user`` also provides a ``@authorize(permission)`` decorator in the ``dycm.user.decorator`` module. On every request to this controller the decorator will call ``check_permission`` as described above to authorize the user with the given permission.
