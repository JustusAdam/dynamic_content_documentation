=========================================================

Content Management System for web application.

The goal is to create a fast and easily expandable, modular CMS for every use imaginable. When finished and polished the core should be usable with only very few modules to allow custom application as well as provide a good amount of common functionality in the core modules to make getting started quick and easy.
