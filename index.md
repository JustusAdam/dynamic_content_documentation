# Welcome to the dynamic_content documentation!

## What is dynamic_content

dynamic_content is a lightweight framework for web applications and a module collection designed to provide a fully functional content management system out of the box.

The goal is to create a fast and easily expandable, modular framework for every use imaginable. When finished and polished the core should be usable with only very few modules to allow custom application as well as a good amount of common functionality in the core modules to make getting started quick and easy.

As of now the Core framework and the basic modules are just about 316KB big (uncompressed) which leads to a running application with a memory usage of only about 14-19MB with python3 (and 80-100MB with pypy due to compiled code).

100% Python 3.
