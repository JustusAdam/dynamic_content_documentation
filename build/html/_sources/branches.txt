Branches and Versions
=====================

There are (will be soon) three major braches for dynamic_content.

stable
------

Release branch, recommended for use. (does not exist yet, since there has not been a finished release yet), only receives fixes and minor/security updates until new releases.

testing
-------

Supposedly working build (to the best of everyones knowledge), as such technically usable but intended to finding errors and bugs.  constantly updated.

master
------

Experimental branch, rather often broken. Main branch for development.
